Here are some steps to get your pnp4nagios working
with Nagios and your webserver; it is intended primarily
for the "new user". If you already have pnp4nagios
working with your Nagios and httpd server, you can
skip this, except perhaps as a source of tips. 


In summary:

  * [A] get the Nagios data to pnp4nagios
  * [B] make pnp4nagios links on Nagios pages
  * [C] make pnp4nagios available on webserver

**[A] get the Nagios data to pnp4nagios**

There are several options for feeding Nagios data to
pnp4nagios, and you need to choose one:

  * **sync**: gets executed on each update,
     best choice for a "low activity" Nagios

  * **bulk**: batches updates, but otherwise like
     the synchronous option in how the updates are
     processed into the RRD database.

  * **npcd**: bulk output, npcd server grabs the updates on
    a regular schedule and deals with them; best for a 
    "high activity" Nagios.

Choose one of these options **MODE**=(sync, bulk, or npcd), then
change directory to @SYSCONFDIR@/config_suggestions/**MODE**
and do ./SuggestInstall 

This will install a modified @NAGIOS_CFG@, 
a modified @NAGIOS_OBJ@/objects/templates.cfg, 
a new @NAGIOS_OBJ@/objects/pnp.cfg

**[B] make pnp4nagios links on Nagios pages**

The one easy way to do this is to add a pair of new 
definitions to the Nagios "templates.cfg" file to
make host and service templates that just contain a
action_url link to pnp4nagios code.  Then add
a "use" line in the "generic-host" and "generic-service"
definitions so that they'll include the pnp4nagios templates.

You can also edit the generic-* templates directly to add the
action urls. 

**[C] make pnp4nagios available on webserver**

This is done by a "pnp4nagios.conf" file that 
(for Apache) is placed in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ 
It defines urls like /pnp4nagios/... to get handled
by the pnp4nagios code.  Most of what is needed is
to make sure that the pnp4nagios code is in the
same "security domain" as your Nagios server, so
that you don't have to enter passwords twice, once
for a Nagios page and again for a pnp4nagios graph.

For password authentication, that is done by adjusting the
**AuthName** and **AuthType** to be the same as your 
Nagios server, and pointing the **AuthUserFile** to the 
Nagios file. An attempt at doing the "default setup" is
what is in the pnp4nagios.conf file.

For more complicated authentication schemes (user certificates,
etc) the general rule is "copy what you use for Nagios". 


** Where to find configuration settings **

Where to find config info: 

    @SYSCONFDIR@
        config.php
        config_local.php (not present by default)
        config.d/*.php   (not present by default)
        npcd.cfg
        process_perfdata.cfg
        rra.cfg (not present by default, check in @SYSCONFDIR@/samples)
        
    @datarootdir@/application/config/config.php
    (linked to @SYSCONFDIR@/cgi_config.php    
    
When things go wrong, it's useful to increase the logging level
and see more.  Logging of the Nagios to RRD steps can be
found in npcd.cfg (for NPCD mode processing) or 
process_perfdata.cfg for all processing modes.

For the problems that show up when displaying graphs, the 
logging level in cgi_config.php is
most helpful; the log file (if you're not using the system
log) is in @localstatedir@/kohana/

When it's a "selinux problem", then you need to check in
/var/log/message or journalctl. The messages generally give
information about how to work around the security violations,
which can be extremely useful for updating the selinux 
configuration for pnp4nagios.
